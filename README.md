# arche

## Dependencies
* [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)
* [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)
* mysql

# Setup

1. Save the example [profile.clj](example-profile.clj) file to the root
of the project under the name "profile.clj".
2. Edit the profile.clj file to match your mysql setup
3. Create a mysql database whose name corresponds to the `database-name`
in your custom `profile.clj` file.
4. Create the tables by running: `lein clj-sql-up migrate`

## Running Locally
Arche depends on values assigned to a number of environmental
variables described [below](#environmental-variables). For local
development purposes, these values can either be assigned as exports
in the shell or using a `profile.clj` file.

To run a local version arche, use the following command:

`lein with-profile dev ring server-headless`

## Standalone

1. Compile the application: `lein uberjar`
2. Assign all the environmental variables listed below in the shell
that you will run the web application
3. Execute the command in the same shell as the environmental
variables: `java -cp target/uberjar/arche-standalone.jar clojure.main
-m arche.core`

## Testing the Running App

If everything has been setup correctly, you can test the app using
curl.

If the arche is listening to port 3000 on localhost and its `BASE_URI`
assigned to localhost, and excute `curl -H "application/hal+json"
http://localhost:3000/`. The correct response is the following:

``` json
{
    "_links": {
        "profile": {
            "href": "http://localhost:3000/alps/EntryPoints"
        },
        "type": {
            "href": "http://localhost:3000/alps/EntryPoints#entry_points"
        },
        "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:3000"
        }
    }
}
```

## Production
### Environmental variables

* `BASE_URI` - The URI that Arche use to construct links; e.g.,
   "http://localhost:3000" or "http://www.neomantic.com"
* `DATABASE_USER` - The mysql user who has access to the database
* `DATABASE_PASSWORD` - The user's credentials to the database
* `DATABASE_HOST` - The host of the mysql server
* `DATABASE_NAME` - The name of the database
* `CACHE_EXPIRY` - The number of seconds Arche assigns in the
  Cache-Control response headers
